Configure Generator Install and Run Insturction

#Installation ( One - Time )
Step 1: Log into  Palmetto
Step 2: Use command 'module load anaconda/4.2.0' and 'module load python/2.7.6' to load up anaconda and python 
Step 3: Use the following command 'conda create --name biodepviz pyqt'
Step 4: Type 'y'
Step 5: When done use 'source deactivate'


#Run:

Step 0 : Log into plametto with -X server 
Windows: https://wiki.utdallas.edu/wiki/display/FAQ/X11+Forwarding+using+Xming+and+PuTTY
Mac or Linux : ssh -X username@user.palmetto.clemson.edu 

Step 1: qsub -X -I -l select=1:ncpus=8:mem=16gb:ngpus=1:gpu_model=k40,walltime=2:30:00
Step 2: First insert 'source activate biodepviz'
Step 3: cd ConfigGenerator
Step 4: To run use 'python server.py'

A large window should pop up outside the terminal. In the section labeled "Add New Network" the Taxon ID and organism name must be provided. Tab delimited Graph Id file must go in the blank area labeled "Network File", and the Ontology file provided can go in the slot labeled "Ontology File". For x, y, and z coordinates used recommended numbers (-100,0,0 for condition 1 and 100,0,0 for condition 2). 




Step 5: When done use 'source deactivate'


#Error Debugging 
IF you get the error Regarding Pyqt4 not found Please do the following
Step 0: module load anaconda/4.2.0
Stpe 1 : source activate 'biodepviz'
Step 2 : conda install pyqt=4.11.4
Step 3 : type 'y'
Step 4 : try running again using 'python server.py'



#Usage Documentation.
A user interface is implemented for the ease of loading and visualizing. 
The 'Add New Network' window allows the user to load a network (and ontology) file along with specifying the x, y, and z coordinate position for the network on the display window. 
Multiple networks can be added and viewed in the central window. Networks can also be deleted when selected in the 'Networks Added' window and using 'Remove Selected' button. 
In the 'Aligned Networks' window, the drop down selections can be used to select the networks in order to load and visualize their alignments. A bit score file for the purpose of calculating alignment can also be read into BioDep-Vis. 
The Alignment folder provides the path to the location of the alignments networks, where as Json Folder points to the directory where the json file for the configuration is written.
